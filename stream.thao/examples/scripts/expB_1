# Example Script 1: 
#

# 
# Register the stream S with 4 attributes
#

table : register stream temp (location char(50), Degrees integer);

#
# The location of the stream.  When you actually run the script make sure
# that the relative path of the source is valid.
#

source : data/mytemp.dat


table : register stream wind (location char(50), direction integer, windSpeed integer);
source : data/mywind.dat

#
# The query over S and R
#

query: select w.location, AVG(windSpeed), AVG(direction),AVG(Degrees) from wind [now] as w, temp [Range 10 Seconds] where w.location = temp.location Group By w.location;
